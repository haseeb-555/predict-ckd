**Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction**

---

**Overview:**

This project utilizes Flask, a Python micro web framework, to deploy a machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD). The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 400 samples using the XGBoost classifier.

**Features:**

- Predicts the likelihood of chronic kidney disease based on various medical parameters.
- User-friendly interface for inputting medical data and obtaining predictions.
- Seamless deployment using Flask, enabling easy access for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the application through your web browser at the provided URL.

**Model Details:**

- Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
- Training Data: 400 samples
- Features: Various medical parameters including age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, etc.
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

**Contributing:**

Contributions to improve the model's performance or enhance the application's features are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.

**Disclaimer:**

This application is intended for educational and informational purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Consult a qualified healthcare provider for any medical concerns.
